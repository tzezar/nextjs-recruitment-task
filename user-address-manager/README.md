I approached this task as an opportunity to learn something new, so I decided to give ShadCN UI a try. Unfortunately, I ran into a few tricky bugs while implementing the features. I also considered using Tanstack Table and Tanstack Query, but the scale of the project was too small for that to be necessary.

During the task, I encountered several bugs in ShadCN UI, such as:
https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/issues/468
https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/issues/1836#issuecomment-1674338372
I was able to fix some of these issues, but there's still one remaining problem: after submitting the form, clicking anything becomes impossible. This seems to be related to focus management when dealing with multiple popovers. Since resolving third-party issues is outside the scope of this task, Iâ€™m leaving it as is for now. Apologies for the inconvenience! ðŸ˜…
